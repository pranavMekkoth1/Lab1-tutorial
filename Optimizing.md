# Optimizing Remote running

**Instructions:**
* Experiment with running commands in the terminals of your compter(on VScode) and on the server to find shortcuts and quicker ways to do things. 
* Hints: You can run a ssh command with quotes at the end to run it directly on your server. You can also use semicolons to run multiple commmands on the same line. You can also use the up arrow key to find/run previously used commands.

Example:
